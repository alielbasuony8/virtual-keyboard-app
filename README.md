# Virtual Keyboard App
### This is a simple web application but contains alot of logic. This app is a virtual keyboard or on-screen keyboard with English and Arabic characters using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows the user to type text in either language using the mouse. and switch between the languages using a toggle button. The app also has some features such as shift, backspace, clear, copy, local storage to save the keyboard mode, and session storage to save the input once you focus in the input field. All that remains is to add events to arrow keys that can enhance the user experience, which I will finish later.
## Features:
#### The app uses HTML to create the elements for the keyboard and the text area.
#### The app uses CSS to style the elements and create a responsive and attractive design.
#### The app uses JavaScript to add functionality and interactivity to the elements, such as changing the language mode, appending characters, deleting characters, clearing text, copying text, moving cursor, etc.
#### The app uses localStorage to store and retrieve the language mode and input value across browser sessions.
#### The app uses togglebutton to switch between Arabic and English mode.
